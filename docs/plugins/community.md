# Community Plugins

Community plugins are third-party packages that extend UAGENT with new
channels, tools, providers, or other capabilities. They are built and maintained
by the community, published on [ClawHub](/tools/clawhub) or npm, and
installable with a single command.

ClawHub is the canonical discovery surface for community plugins. Do not open
docs-only PRs just to add your plugin here for discoverability; publish it on
ClawHub instead.

```bash
uagent plugins install <package-name>
```

UAGENT checks ClawHub first and falls back to npm automatically.

## Submit your plugin

We welcome community plugins that are useful, documented, and safe to operate.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Publish to ClawHub or npm">
    Your plugin must be installable via `uagent plugins install \<package-name\>`.
    Publish to [ClawHub](/tools/clawhub) (preferred) or npm.
    See [Building Plugins](/plugins/building-plugins) for the full guide.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Host on GitHub">
    Source code must be in a public repository with setup docs and an issue
    tracker.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use docs PRs only for source-doc changes">
    You do not need a docs PR just to make your plugin discoverable. Publish it
    on ClawHub instead.

    Open a docs PR only when UAGENT's source docs need an actual content
    change, such as correcting install guidance or adding cross-repo
    documentation that belongs in the main docs set.

  </Step>
